# Plena-Coding-Chellenge


This is a runable java file, just put it into any testing project in any IDE and just run as java class, I have written the main
function. 
As long as the system has the JDK library, it should be fine. 
Just input the String int the prompt, and then the program will first print out the final String and return the character back.
If none of any character shown up just once, it will return an null.(We should use Exceptions in work~) 


Thanks!!
